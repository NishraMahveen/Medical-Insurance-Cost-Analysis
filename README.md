# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Analysis
The main goal of this project is to study information about charges (like medical bills) and figure out what factors affect these charges.
We'll then create formulas to predict charges based on these factors.
To do this, we'll first organize and clean the data, then look for patterns in the data to understand what factors influence charges the most.
After that, we'll build formulas (models) to estimate charges, and refine them to make better predictions.
